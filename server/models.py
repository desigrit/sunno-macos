# Streaming transducer models, which are a different shape from a Whisper checkpoint: an
# encoder, a decoder and a joiner rather than one file. Kept apart from _REPOS so that a
# Whisper id can never resolve to half of one of these.
#
# The two differ in licence, and it is the sharpest difference in the catalogue. `stream-en`
# is Apache-2.0, declared in the repo's own metadata. `stream-en-kroko` has no declared
# licence at all, and the chain was followed rather than assumed: the repo that serves the
# ONNX files declares nothing (`cardData: null`) and its README says only "See license at
# .../Banafo/Kroko-ASR"; that repo declares `license: other` with `license_name: "test"` and
# `license_link: LICENSE`; that LICENSE file is zero bytes. CC-BY-SA appears only as prose in
# a README that splits models into community and commercial tiers without saying which tier
# this checkpoint is in. So the honest description is "no grant", not "ShareAlike".
#
# There is a second, separate gap. Banafo publishes `.data` files; the repo above serves
# `encoder.onnx` / `decoder.onnx` / `joiner.onnx`. Somebody converted them, unattributed, so
# the app fetches a third party's conversion rather than an artifact from the author. Even a
# clear licence from Banafo would not by itself cover that.
#
# It ships anyway, as a deliberate and recorded decision by the project owner, who was shown
# the above and accepted it. What that costs is not hidden: the model is never auto-selected
# (see AUTO_SELECT_EXCLUDED) and THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md carries a section stating the licence
# position plainly. The catalogue description used to say it too and no longer does, removed
# on the owner's instruction because it made that row read as a warning beside every other
# model; the notices are the place it is recorded. What it buys is readability rather than
# speed: it writes its own capitals and punctuation, and it revises text already on screen
# far less often, 44 caption refreshes in 251 against 147. On latency the two are near-tied,
# 120 ms against 135 on the same clip and thread count, so speed is not the argument for it.
# An earlier version of this comment claimed 80 against 130, which did not reproduce; see

#
# No punctuation model yet. sherpa-onnx publishes a 7 MB streaming punctuation and casing
# model that would give `stream-en` sentence case, measured at 4.6 ms, but it also has no
# licence and only reaches this app as a GitHub release tarball, so it brings a download path
# with no resume or integrity check. Kroko already punctuates, which is most of the reason to
# want it. The candidate is `sherpa-onnx-online-punct-en-2024-08-06`, in the k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx
