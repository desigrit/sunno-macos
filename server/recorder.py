"""Write a recording of the conversation to disk.

Sunno held audio in memory only until this existed. That was a promise as much as an
implementation, so the way this writes matters:

**Nothing is written until asked.** A Recorder is only constructed when the user presses
record, and the directory is only created then. An install that never records leaves no trace.

**A recording ends when the user says so, and not before.** Pausing, switching microphone,
changing model and a dropped USB cable all stop capture, and none of them should end a
recording: they should leave a gap in it. Pause and a transient failure keep the same process,
so the Recorder simply stops being fed. Changing device or model restarts the backend
entirely, so a recording has to be re-openable across processes -- which is why the audio is
appended as raw PCM rather than written through a container that owns its own header.

**A crash must not cost the meeting.** The scenario this exists for is a conversation that
cannot be re-run, so nothing is buffered for the end. Audio is appended as it arrives and each
finished line is appended immediately. Both survive the process dying at any point: raw PCM
has nothing to corrupt, and a JSONL file is valid up to its last complete line. AAC in an MP4
container is the opposite -- it needs its index written on close, and a killed encoder leaves
a file that will not play at all -- so the m4a is produced at the end, by transcoding.

**A killed process leaves recoverable work.** ``recover`` finds any recording that was never
finalised and completes it on the next launch, so the file appears rather than being lost.

The audio is the recogniser's own stream: 16 kHz mono, tapped ahead of ``preprocess`` so it is
what the microphone heard rather than what the model was fed. Fine for speech, and it means
the audio and the transcript can never disagree, because they are the same samples.
